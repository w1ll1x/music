# Mystical Journey

### The song is supposed to be a journey through time, in a mystical world. It is broken up into four different movements.

## First Movement: Introduction

The first movement is designed to orient the listener to the song, it is supposed to be reminiscent of entering a majical mysterious place. Soothing synth overlaid with individual notes create welling sound that sounds both magical and new.

## Second Movement: Growth

The second movement is supposed to encorperate a feeling of growing, the notes play in ascending pattern, and certain arpeggios feel sad while others are more
happy to feel like life. 

## Third Movement: The storm 

The third movement opens with a long bass synth line, sort of like rain, and is the loudest and most unsettling of the three movements. It is overlaid with slightly off key notes, that play in a falling pattern, and get quieter and then louder.

## Fourth Movement: The resolution

The fourth movement is the resolution, it is in some ways an inverse of the introduction, again with arpeggiated chords, though this time the arpegio plays before the chord.
